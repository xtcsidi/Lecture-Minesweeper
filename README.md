# Lecture Minesweeper ðŸ’£ðŸš©

## What's this?

Ever been stuck in a mind-numbing lecture, wishing you could blow something up? Well, here's the next best thing! I whipped up this Minesweeper clone while trying not to fall asleep in class. It's not perfect, but hey, neither is my attendance record.

## Features

- Click to reveal cells
- Right-click to plant flags
- Emojis! Because who doesn't love a good bomb emoji? ðŸ’£
- A flag counter, for those who like to keep score
- Potentially buggy gameplay (I call them "surprise features")

## How to Play

1. Run `python minesweeper_gui.py`
2. Click stuff
3. Try not to blow up
4. ALT + TAB to your notes when the professor looks your way

## Disclaimer

This game was created under the influence of boredom and delusion. Any resemblance to actual, functional software is purely coincidental.

Remember, this code is about as perfect as my lecture notes - which is to say, not very. But it's got character!

Enjoy responsibly, and maybe pay attention in class sometimes. ðŸ˜‰
